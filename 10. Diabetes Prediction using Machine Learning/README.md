# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and trains machine learning models to predict diabetes.

## Files
- Diabetes Prediction.ipynb — main notebook with EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- diabetes.csv — dataset used by the notebook

## Overview
The notebook performs:
- Data loading and exploratory data analysis (visualizations and summary statistics)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (scaling, handling missing values if any)
- Model training (for example: Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

## Requirements
Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
1. Install dependencies (see above).
2. Start Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Diabetes Prediction.ipynb"
```

3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially.

## Dataset
The dataset `diabetes.csv` is included in this repository. Keep it in the same folder as the notebook.

## Notes
- The notebook is intended for educational purposes and experimentation.
